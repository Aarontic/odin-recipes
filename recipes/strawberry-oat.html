    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This smoothie is a great way to start the day. As a breakfast smoothie,
        oats are preferred, you can also add other fruits as well! I recommend either blueberries or 
        a banana as an alternative. Might as well mix some of them up as well if you'd like.
